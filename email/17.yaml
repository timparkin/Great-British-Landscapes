  In this issue we have a new interview video from Paul Gallagher where he talks about his approaches to black and white photography and much more. Max Rush presents a project on Brockwell Park, London through the seasons and Mike Green looks at the human form in landscape photography. 

  This issue also sees another film test, an epic undertaking that lets us see just how different films render different subject matter. Richard Childs returns with another Letter from Scotland about his ongoing work on the isle of Eigg and Tim Smalley talks about getting into and out of a creative rut. 

  Our featured photographer this month is Paul Moon - someone who has really made his local patch, the Yorkshire Wolds, his speciality. Finally, David Tolcher reviews the new Rolls Royce of geared tripod heads, the Arca D4.
